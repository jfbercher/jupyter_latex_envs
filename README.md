**Maintainer(s) wanted**... 
Unfortunately, I, @jfbercher, don't have the time to continue the development of this extension, which I still use very often. 
Are there any volunteers to maintain it or continue the development? A big project would be to port it to jupyter-lab.

(some) LaTeX environments for Jupyter notebook
==============================================

This extension for Jupyter notebook enables the use of some LaTeX
commands and environments markdown cells.

1.  **LaTeX commands and environments**
    -   support for some LaTeX commands within markdown cells, *e.g.*
        `\textit`, `\textbf`, `\underline`.
    -   support for **theorems-like environments**, support for labels
        and cross references
    -   support for **lists**: *enumerate, itemize*,
    -   limited support for a **figure environment**,
    -   support for an environment *listing*,
    -   additional *textboxa* environment
2.  **Citations and bibliography**
    -   support for `\cite` with creation of a References section
3.  **Document-wide numbering of equations and environments, support for
    `\label` and `\ref`**
4.  **Configuration toolbar**
5.  **LaTeX\_envs dropdown menu for a quick insertion of environments**
6.  **User's LaTeX definitions** file can be loaded and used
7.  **Export to plain HTML, Slides and LaTeX with a customized
    exporter**
8.  Environments title/numbering can be customized by users in
    `user_envs.json` config file.
9.  Styles can be customized in the `latex_env.css` stylesheet
10. **Autocompletion** for \$, (, {, \[, for LaTeX commands and
    environments

More environments can be simply added in `user_envs.json` or in the
source file (`thmsInNb4.js`).

It is possible to export the notebooks to plain $\LaTeX$ and html while
keeping all the features of the `latex_envs` notebook extension in the
converted version. We provide specialized exporters, pre and post
processors, templates. We also added entry-points to simplify the
conversion process. It is now as simple as

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
jupyter nbconvert --to html_with_lenvs FILE.ipynb
```

or

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
jupyter nbconvert --to latex_with_lenvs FILE.ipynb
```

to convert `FILE.ipynb` into html/latex while keeping all the features
of the `latex_envs` notebook extension in the converted version. Other
options are `slides_with_lenvs` for converting to reveal-js
presentations, and `html_with_toclenvs` to include a table of contents.
The LaTeX converter also expose several conversion options (read the
[docs](https://rawgit.com/jfbercher/jupyter_latex_envs/master/src/latex_envs/static/doc/latex_env_doc.html)).

Demo/documentation
------------------

The `doc` subdirectory that constains an example notebook and its html
and pdf versions. This serves as the documentation. A demo notebook
`latex_env_doc.ipynb` is provided. Its html version is
[latex\_env\_doc.html](https://rawgit.com/jfbercher/jupyter_latex_envs/master/src/latex_envs/static/doc/latex_env_doc.html)
serves as
[documentation](https://rawgit.com/jfbercher/jupyter_latex_envs/master/src/latex_envs/static/doc/latex_env_doc.html).

Installation
------------

The extension consists of a pypi package that includes a javascript
notebook extension, along with python code for nbconvert support. Since
Jupyter 4.2, pypi is the recommended way to distribute nbextensions. The
extension can be installed

-   from the master version on the github repo (this will be always the
    most recent version)
-   via pip for the version hosted on Pypi
-   via conda, from the [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.github.io/)
    [channel](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge)
-   as part of the great
    [jupyter\_contrib\_nbextensions](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions)
    collection. Follow the instructions there for installing. Once this
    is done, you can open a tab at `http://localhost:8888/nbextensions`
    to enable and configure the various extensions.

From the github repo or from Pypi,

1.  install the package
    -   `pip3 install https://github.com/jfbercher/jupyter_latex_envs/archive/master.zip [--user][--upgrade]`
    -   or `pip3 install jupyter_latex_envs [--user][--upgrade]`
    -   or clone the repo and install git clone
        [https://github.com/jfbercher/jupyter\\\_latex\\\_envs.git](https://github.com/jfbercher/jupyter\_latex\_envs.git)
        python3 setup.py install
2.  install the notebook extension

        jupyter nbextension install --py latex_envs [--user|--sys-prefix|--system]

3.  and enable it

        jupyter nbextension enable --py latex_envs [--user|--sys-prefix|--system]

For Jupyter versions before 4.2, the situation after step 1 is more
tricky, since the `--py` option isn't available, so you will have to
find the location of the source files manually as follows (instructions
adapted from \[@jcb91\](<https://github.com/jcb91>)'s
[jupyter\_highlight\_selected\_word](https://github.com/jcb91/jupyter_highlight_selected_word)).
Execute

    python -c "import os.path as p; from latex_envs import __file__ as f, _jupyter_nbextension_paths as n; print(p.normpath(p.join(p.dirname(f), n()[0]['src'])))"

Then, issue

    jupyter nbextension install <output source directory>
    jupyter nbextension enable latex_envs/latex_envs

where `<output source directory>` is the output of the first python
command.

Disclaimer, sources and acknowledgments
---------------------------------------

Originally, I used a piece of code from the nice online markdown editor
[stackedit](https://github.com/benweet/stackedit/issues/187), where the
authors also considered the problem of incorporating LaTeX markup in
their markdown.

I also studied and used examples and code from
[ipython-contrib/jupyter\_contrib\_nbextensions](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions).

-   This is done in the hope it can be useful. However there are many
    impovements possible, in the code and in the documentation.
    **Contributions will be welcome and deeply appreciated.**
