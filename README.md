(some) LaTeX environments for Jupyter notebook
==============================================

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/jupyter_latex_envs/Lobby](https://badges.gitter.im/jupyter_latex_envs/Lobby.svg)](https://gitter.im/jupyter_latex_envs/Lobby?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

This extension for Jupyter notebook enables to use some LaTeX commands and environments markdown cells. 

1. **LaTeX commands and environments**
    - support for some LaTeX commands within markdown cells, *e.g.* `\textit`, `\textbf`, `\underline`
    - support for **theorems-like environments**, support for labels and cross references
    - support for **lists**: *enumerate, itemize*,  
    - limited support for a **figure environment**,
    - support for an environment *listing*,
    - additional *textboxa* environment
2. **Citations and bibliography**
    - support for `\cite` with creation of a References section
3. **Document-wide numbering of equations and environments, support for `\label` and `\ref`**
4. **Configuration toolbar**
5. **LaTeX_envs dropdown menu for a quick insertion of environments**
6. **User's LaTeX definitions** file can be loaded and used 
7. **Export to HTML and LaTeX with a customized exporter**
8. Styles can be customized in the `latex_env.css` stylesheet

More environments can be simply added in the source file (`thmsInNb4.js`). 

It is possible to export the notebooks to plain $\LaTeX$ and html while keeping all the features of the `latex_envs` notebook extension in the converted version. We provide specialized exporters, pre and post processors, templates. We also added entry-points to simplify the conversion process. It is now as simple asIt is now as simple as
```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to html_with_lenvs FILE.ipynb
```
or 
```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to latex_with_lenvs FILE.ipynb
```
to convert `FILE.ipynb` into html/latex while keeping all the features of the `latex_envs` notebook extension in the converted version. The LaTeX converter also expose several conversion options (read the [docs](https://rawgit.com/jfbercher/jupyter_latex_envs/master/src/latex_envs/static/doc/latex_envs_doc.html). 


Demo/documentation
==================

The `doc` subdirectory that constains an example notebook and its html and pdf versions. This serves as the documentation. 
A demo notebook `latex_env_doc.ipynb` is provided. Its html version is [latex_env_doc.html](https://rawgit.com/jfbercher/jupyter_latex_envs/master/src/latex_envs/static/doc/latex_env_doc.html) and a pdf resulting 
from conversion to LaTeX is available as [documentation](https://rawgit.com/jfbercher/jupyter_latex_envs/master/src/latex_envs/static/doc/documentation.pdf). 


Installation
============

The extension consists in a package that includes a javascript notebook extension. Since Jupyter 4.2, this is the recommended way to distribute nbextensions. The extension can be installed

- from the master version on the github repo (this will be always the most recent version)
- via pip for the version hosted on Pypi
- as part of the great [Jupyter-notebook-extensions](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/Jupyter-notebook-extensions) collection. Follow the instructions there for installing. Once this is done, you can open a tab at  `http://localhost:8888/nbextensions` to enable and configure the various extensions. 

From the github repo or from Pypi, 

- **step 1**: install the package
     - `pip3 install https://github.com/jfbercher/jupyter_latex_envs/archive/master.zip [--user][--upgrade]`
     -  <span style="color:blue"> or</span> `pip3 install jupyter_latex_envs [--user][--upgrade]`
     - <span style="color:blue"> or</span> clone the repo and install
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/jfbercher/jupyter_latex_envs.git
   python3 setup.py install
   ```
 
With Jupyter >= 4.2, step 1 should sufficient as the files will be automatically copied to the target drectories and the extension enabled. For ealier versions of Jupyter or if something fails, you will have to add two more steps. 

- **step 2**: install the notebook extension 
```
jupyter nbextension install --py latex_envs [--user]
```

-  **step 3**: and enable it
```
jupyter nbextension enable latex_envs [--user] --py
```

For Jupyter versions before 4.2, the situation is more tricky since you will have to find the location of the source files (instructions from @jcb91 found [here](https://github.com/jcb91/jupyter_highlight_selected_word)): execute 
```
python -c "import os.path as p; from jupyter_highlight_selected_word import __file__ as f, _jupyter_nbextension_paths as n; print(p.normpath(p.join(p.dirname(f), n()[0]['src'])))"
```
Then, issue 
```
jupyter nbextension install <output source directory>
jupyter nbextension enable latex_envs/latex_envs
```
where `<output source directory>` is the output of the python command.

Originally, I used a piece of code from the nice online markdown editor `stackedit` [https://github.com/benweet/stackedit/issues/187](https://github.com/benweet/stackedit/issues/187), where the authors also considered the problem of incorporating LaTeX markup in their markdown. 

I also studied and used examples and code from [https://github.com/ipython-contrib/IPython-notebook-extensions](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/IPython-notebook-extensions).

- This is done in the hope it can be useful. However there are many impovements possible, in the code and in the documentation. 
**Contributions will be welcome and deeply appreciated.**
